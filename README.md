# Data Science Studies 📚⚡

This repository is my learning log for **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** while studying **Electrical Engineering (UFF)**.  
It’s a structured space where I test ideas, build small experiments, and turn curiosity into reproducible notebooks and scripts.

My long-term goal is to apply AI/ML to real engineering problems (automation, monitoring, diagnosis, forecasting, optimization) — the kind of work that can help labs and companies make better decisions with data.

## What you'll find here

- **Notebooks (`/notebooks`)**  
  Explorations, experiments, and study notes with code + explanations (Jupyter `.ipynb`).

- **Scripts (`/scripts`)**  
  Reusable Python code (utilities, small tools, helpers) that I keep organized outside notebooks.

- **Data (`/data`)**  
  Local datasets for experiments.  
  **Note:** large or private datasets are not uploaded to GitHub (this folder is typically ignored by git).

## How to run (quick start)

I usually work with a Conda environment called `estudos`.

1. Create/activate the environment:
 ```bash
   conda activate estudos
  ```

2. (Optional) Install dependencies:
 ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
If requirements.txt is not present yet, I install libraries as needed while studying.

3. Open notebooks:
VS Code (recommended): open the repo and run notebooks with the selected interpreter or Jupyter:
 ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```


## Current focus

- **Python foundations (clean code, debugging, functions, files)**
- **Data analysis with NumPy and Pandas**
- **Visualization with Matplotlib**
- **Classical ML with scikit-learn**
- **Reproducibility habits (git workflow, readable notebooks, clear project structure)**

## Notes for collaborators / mentors
If you're a colleague, professor, or someone from FriendsLab, feel free to browse, suggest improvements, or point me to problems worth solving.
I’m especially interested in projects involving:
- **Power systems data**
- **Sensor/measurement pipelines**
- **Anomaly detection & diagnostics**
- **Load/energy forecasting**
- **Applied ML for engineering decision support**
